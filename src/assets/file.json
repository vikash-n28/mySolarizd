The official music video for 'Grenade' by Bruno Mars from doo-wops and hooligans - available now on Elektra Records!\n\nDirected by Nabil\n\n\"Today, I get to share with you the visual companion piece to my new single, 'Grenade.' The song is about loving someone so deeply, and the pain of knowing that the person you love does not feel the same. The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate.\" -- Bruno Mars\n\n\nLYRICS\nEasy come, easy go, that's just how you live\nOh, take, take, take it all but you never give\nShould've known you was trouble from the first kiss\nHad your eyes wide open, why were they open?\n\nGave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash\nYou tossed it in the trash, you did\nTo give me all your love is all I ever asked\n'Cause what you don't understand is\n\nI'd catch a grenade for ya\nThrow my hand on a blade for ya\nI'd jump in front of a train for ya\nYou know I'd do anything for ya\n\nI would go through all this pain\nTake a bullet straight through my brain\nYes, I would die for you, baby\nBut you won't do the same\n\nNo, no, no, no\n\nBlack, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb\nTell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from\nMad women, bad women, that's just what you are, yeah\nYou'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car\n\nGave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash\nYou tossed it in the trash, yes, you did\nTo give me all your love is all I ever asked\n'Cause what you don't understand is\n\nI'd catch a grenade for ya\nThrow my hand on a blade for ya\nI'd jump in front of a train for ya\nYou know I'd do anything for ya\n\nI would go through all this pain\nTake a bullet straight through my brain\nYes, I would die for ya, baby\nBut you won't do the same\n\nIf my body was on fire\nOoh, you'd watch me burn down in flames\nYou said you loved me, you're a liar\n'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby\n\nBut darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya\nThrow my hand on a blade for ya\nI'd jump in front of a train for ya\nYou know I'd do anything for ya\n\nI would go through all this pain\nTake a bullet straight through my brain\nYes, I would die for you, baby\nBut you won't do the same\n\nNo, you won't do the same\nYou wouldn't do the same\nOoh, you never do the same\nNo, no, no, no"
